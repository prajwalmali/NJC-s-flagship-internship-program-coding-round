## Introduction
This repository is created as a part of NJC's MuleSoft flagship Internship program. It contains a movie table with name, actor, actress, director, year of release as its attributes. Data is retrieved from the table by using queries, with the help of SQL.

1. Created "movie_db" database with table name "MOVIES" and stored details of movies.
2. File '_dbconnect.php' is used to connect to XAMPP server.
3. File 'queries.php' is used to execute queries and display the output table in website.
4. File 'movies.sql' contains all the SQL queries used in this test.
